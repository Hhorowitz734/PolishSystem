# Polish System Computational History Visualizer

## Description
The concept known as the "Polish System" was conceived in the 1820s and gained widespread recognition during the 1830s and 1840s, largely due to the efforts of General JÃ³zef Bem. Bem, a skilled military engineer with a strong inclination towards mnemonic techniques, was instrumental in promoting this system. This project is a digital recreation, capturing the essence and intricacies of the original Polish System, while leveraging modern technology to reimagine and preserve its historical significance.

## Features
- Country Marking: Users can easily identify and mark countries on the digital map. This feature enables the highlighting of specific nations for geopolitical studies.
- [TODO] Conflict and War Annotation: The tool allows users to annotate regions with information about historical or ongoing conflicts and wars. This feature is particularly useful for historians, educators, and students, providing a visual representation of conflict zones across the globe.
- [TODO] Customizable Notes: Users have the ability to add custom notes to any location on the map. This flexibility is ideal for adding context, personal experiences, or detailed information about specific places.
- [TODO] Save and Load Functionality: The project supports saving the current state of the map, including all markings, annotations, and notes, into a .txt file format. This allows for easy sharing and continuation of work. Additionally, users can load previously saved files to resume their work or review past projects.

## Installation Instructions

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and installing the EquationParser project on your system.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure your system has the following installed:

- CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
- A C++ compiler supporting C++17 standard (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- Raylib (version 4.5.0)
- Google Test for unit testing

You can install Raylib and Google Test via a package manager like Homebrew on macOS or the respective package manager for your operating system.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the PolishSystem repository from its source. This step assumes you have `git` installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hhorowitz734/PolishSystem
cd PolishSystem
```

### Step 2: Install Raylib and CUnit

If you haven't already installed Raylib and Google Test, you can do so using Homebrew on macOS:

```bash
brew install raylib
brew install googletest
```

For other operating systems, please refer to the official documentation for Raylib and CUnit for installation instructions.

### Step 3: Build the Project

Once the prerequisites are installed, you can build the project using CMake:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This will compile the main application along with the necessary libraries.

### Step 4: Run Tests

To ensure everything is set up correctly, run the included tests:

```bash
ctest
```

This command will execute all the tests defined in the CMake configuration.

### Step 5: Running the Application

After successfully building the project and passing the tests, you can run the EquationParser application after updating your equation in the main.c.

```bash
./PolishSystem
```

This command will start the application. Follow any on-screen instructions to interact with the program.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation or running the application, email me at hhorowitz734@gmail.com.
